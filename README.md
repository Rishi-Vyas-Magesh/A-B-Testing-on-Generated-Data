# A-B-Testing-on-Generated-Data

This is a synthetic dataset shared by my mentor for A/B testing analysis in deciding which Social Media Ad variant is better and which to choose for publishing. I ahve attached the dataset and the features/metrics it measures which factor in choosing an Ad. My IPYNB file analysing the data, plots, comparisons and insightful questions with answers is also attached. It shows my data handling capabilities and interpretation of statistically significant data.
